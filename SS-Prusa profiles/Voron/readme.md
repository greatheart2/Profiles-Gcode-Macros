I setout to make a bare bones profile that is safe (ie not fast) as I can make it. But has a good baseline. The profiles have a good settings that will make a good print. And should only require that you tune the flow. I have intentionally made sure that they do not refrence back to a any gcode or start codes. These should be able to be used standalone and hit print and work conistently. 

Dockable profile just has attach and detach in the start code.
