# Profiles-Gcode-Macros
One stop shop for my shared profiles and configs

I setout to make a bare bones profile that is safe (ie not fast) as I can make it. But has a good baseline. The profiles have a good settings that will make a good print. And should only require that you tune the flow. I have intentionally made sure that they do not refrence back to a any gcode or start codes. These should be able to be used standalone and hit print and work conistently. 

While That does not leverage the power and flexibility we have with klipper and super slicer. This is a good starting point and can be useful for a new printer or to troubleshoot if a issue is slicer related.
